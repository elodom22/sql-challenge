# sql-challenge
This challenge focuses on database management and analysis. As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your task is to reconstruct and analyze an employee database from the 1980s and 1990s using six CSV files. You'll design a relational database schema, import the data into SQL tables, and perform queries to extract meaningful insights. The project is divided into three parts: data modeling (creating an entity relationship diagram), data engineering (structuring and importing data), and data analysis (querying employee records to uncover trends and relationships). This exercise strengthens skills in database design, SQL querying, and data-driven decision-making.
